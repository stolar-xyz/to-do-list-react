I was motivated to start learning because I wanted to create \"something of my own\". Initially, after the failure of creating music in FL Studio, I decided to bet on programming... I became interested in Python, but after a few weeks of learning, I realized it wasn't for me. Then I found a channel on Youtube that explained the basics of HTML and that's how my passion with web development began."}
